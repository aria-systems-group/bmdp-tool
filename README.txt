README

- This tool computes the maximum pessimistic policy/strategy for BMDPs/IMDPs given a property in the form of bounded/unbounded until.  

- For bounded until, MATLAB implementation is used.  For unbounded until, there exist two options: MATLAB and C++ implementations.  To use the C++ code (faster), first the code has to be compiled (in Linux/Mac run the MakeFile --> >> make).

- The details of the model construction and the property specification are shown in main.m.

- To get started run main.m in MATLAB.
